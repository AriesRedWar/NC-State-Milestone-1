The start of it all!!!

This is a Homage to one of the first games I played on the phone (old nokia phones) Snake!!!

- Game play - 
"The object of the game is to eat the dots and grow the Snake as long as you can with out hitting the walls or any part of the Snake's growing body."

- Game controls -
We will be using the Arrow keys on the key board
up arrow = Up
Down arrow = Down
Left arrow = left
Right arrow = Right

Once you have had a game over yuou can fill in the player information and click the submit score buton.

Happy hunting dots!!!!
