This is the start of it all!!!

This is a Homage to one of the first games I played on the phone (old nokia phones) Snake!!!

Game play - "The object of the game is to eat the dots and grow the Snake as long as you can with out hitting the walls or any part of the Snake's growing body."

Game controls -
We will be using the Arrow keys on the key board or if you are left handed you can use the W,A,S,D keys.
W = Up
A = Left
S = Down
D = Right

Happy hunting dots!!!!
